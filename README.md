This package provides utilities to simplify structured data workflows in Python:

- Helpers for using Python Enums with Polars
- Plotting utilities based on Plotly (express and graph_objects) for polars.
- Path management helpers for Dataframely schemas and collections

The goal is to make it easier to work with typed data, advanced plotting, and file organization in modern data projects.
